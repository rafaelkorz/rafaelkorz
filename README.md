### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Front-end Developer from Brazil, based in Blumenau-SC (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· ).

Bachelor in Information System and Technical in software development, over 10 years proven expertise in the area of IT development, I have strong ability at working with SQL, besides a significant experience at different databases systems as Oracle, Microsoft SQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

I worked 6 years with Delphi development and 4 years in back-end Java development for health care systems in the billing area and with industrial manufacturing systems.

I was working with Python 2.2 and 3.4 development around 2 year on projects for fuel station systems but now I'm studing Web development with Node.JS and ReactJS/Native.

Nevertheless, I have been currently studying web and mobile development with NodeJs, React, React Native, CSS, HTML, aiming to be a full stack developer.
